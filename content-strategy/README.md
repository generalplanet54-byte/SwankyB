## 📈 SEO Strategy At-A-Glance

### Keyword Placement Formula

**Primary Keyword Must Appear In:**
1. Page title (H1)
2. URL slug
3. First 100 words
4. At least one H2 subheading
5. Conclusion paragraph
6. Meta description

**Density:** 1-2% (natural, not forced)

**Example:**
- Primary: "best electric shaver for men 2025"
- Appears: 12 times in 5,800-word article = 0.2% density ✅
- Feels natural, not stuffed ✅

### Internal Linking Formula

**Per Article:**
- 3-5 contextual links to related articles
- Varied anchor text (exact, partial, natural)
- Link to hub article from spokes
- Link to related spokes from each spoke
- Cross-cluster where relevant

**Example Navigation Path:**
"Best Electric Shavers" (hub) → "Braun Series 9 Review" (spoke) → "Best Beard Trimmers" (related spoke) → "Complete Grooming Guide" (cross-cluster hub)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Writing Efficiently:

1. **Use the outline as your script** — Don't deviate significantly
2. **Write in order** — H1 → H2 → H3, don't jump around
3. **Benefits first, always** — What does it DO for the reader?
4. **Add CTAs during writing** — Don't backfill them later
5. **Reference Article 1** — Keep it open while writing for tone consistency

### SEO Best Practices:

1. **Natural language first** — Then optimize, not the reverse
2. **One primary keyword** — Don't try to rank for everything
3. **Long-form wins** — 3,000-5,000 words outperforms 1,000-1,500
4. **Update regularly** — Quarterly refreshes maintain rankings
5. **Internal linking matters** — More than you think

### Monetization Optimization:

1. **Trust before CTAs** — Educate, then ask for the click
2. **Test CTA copy** — A/B test different button text
3. **Product order matters** — Best-first usually converts best
4. **Clear recommendations** — Tell them which to buy and why
5. **Multiple link opportunities** — 8-10 CTAs per 5,000-word article
