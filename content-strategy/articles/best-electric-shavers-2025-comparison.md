Our testing winner: **Braun Series 9 PRO+** for sensitive skin + automation priority. Our value champion: **Panasonic Arc5 Elite** for performance on budget. Your choice depends on skin sensitivity, beard coarseness, time constraints, and budget—but every shaver tested beats manual razors on convenience and morning efficiency.
