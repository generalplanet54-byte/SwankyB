## üéì Lessons & Best Practices

### What We Learned Creating This Strategy:

**1. Specificity Wins**
"Orthopedic shoes for men with heel pain" outperforms generic "comfortable shoes" because it targets specific pain points with high buyer intent.

**2. Education Builds Trust**
Articles that explain *why* (e.g., how orthopedic shoes relieve heel pain) convert better than pure product listings.

**3. Benefits Over Features**
"Eliminates morning heel pain" resonates more than "features 10mm heel cup depth."

**4. Authentic Voice Differentiates**
SwankyBoyz's masculine luxury tone stands out in a sea of generic tech review sites.

**5. Long-Form Wins SEO**
3,500-5,000 word comprehensive guides outrank 1,000-word thin content consistently.
