## 📋 Issues Addressed This Session

### 1. ❌ Affiliate Links Showing "Oops" Error Pages
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What Was Wrong:**
- Short URLs (`amzn.to/xxxx`) missing affiliate tag parameter
- Amazon redirects to error page without tag
- No tracking of affiliate clicks
- Links missing proper target/rel attributes

**Solution:**
- Created `public/swanky-fixes.js` script
- Automatically injects `?tag=swankyboyz-20` to all affiliate links
- Handles both `amazon.com` full URLs and `amzn.to` short URLs
- Adds Google Analytics tracking
- Sets proper security attributes (target, rel, noopener)

**Result:** 
✅ All affiliate links now work properly  
✅ Commission tracking enabled  
✅ No more "oops" error pages

### 2. ❌ Pictures Not Loading / Broken Images
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What Was Wrong:**
- Some image URLs lacked optimization parameters
- No fallback when images failed to load
- No retry mechanism for transient failures

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic image retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- Exponential backoff timing (500ms, 1000ms, 1500ms)
- Auto-optimizes Unsplash URLs with proper CDN parameters
- Auto-optimizes Pexels URLs with compression settings
- Falls back to branded SVG placeholder (charcoal + champagne)
- Uses MutationObserver to fix dynamically loaded images

**Result:**
✅ Images retry automatically on failure  
✅ Proper CDN optimization applied  
✅ Branded fallback for permanently broken images  
✅ Dynamic content handled seamlessly

### 3. ❌ Terminal Command Errors
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**What Was Wrong:**

- Exit code 127 (command not found errors)

**Solution:**
- Cleared terminal and ran proper bash commands
- Verified git status is clean
