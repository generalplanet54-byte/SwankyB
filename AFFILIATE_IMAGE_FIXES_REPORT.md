# Affiliate Links & Image Loading Fixes - Technical Report

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. ❌ Affiliate Links Leading to "Oops" Error Pages

**Root Cause:** 
- Short `amzn.to` URLs don't include the affiliate tag (`?tag=swankyboyz-20`)
- Without the tag, Amazon redirects to landing page (sometimes with error state)
- Some links were missing target/rel attributes for proper tracking

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ Created `public/swanky-fixes.js` script that:
- Detects all Amazon affiliate links (both `amazon.com` and `amzn.to`)
- Automatically appends `?tag=swankyboyz-20` to short URLs on click
- Adds proper `target="_blank"` and `rel="nofollow sponsored noopener"` attributes
- Tracks affiliate clicks in Google Analytics
- Handles both full URLs and short redirect URLs

---

### 2. ❌ Images Not Loading / Broken Image URLs

**Root Cause:**
- Some image URLs from Unsplash/Pexels lacked optimization parameters
- No retry logic when images fail to load
- No fallback for permanently broken images

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ Enhanced image handling in `swanky-fixes.js`:
- Detects failed image loads automatically
- Retries loading 3 times with exponential backoff (500ms delays)
- Optimizes Unsplash URLs with: `?auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=80`
- Optimizes Pexels URLs with: `?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=400`
- Falls back to branded SVG placeholder if all retries fail
- Placeholder uses brand colors (charcoal background, champagne text)

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Affiliate Link Flow

```
User clicks affiliate link
    ↓
swanky-fixes.js detects click
    ↓
Checks if URL has affiliate tag
    ↓
If amzn.to short URL → add ?tag=swankyboyz-20
    ↓
Track click in Google Analytics
    ↓
Open Amazon page in new tab with tag
    ↓
Commission tracking activated!
```

### Image Loading Flow

```
Image starts loading
    ↓
If load succeeds → display image ✓
    ↓
If load fails → retry (attempt 1/3)
    ↓
After 500ms → retry with cache-bust parameter
    ↓
If still fails (attempt 2/3) → wait 1000ms, retry
    ↓
If still fails (attempt 3/3) → use branded placeholder
    ↓
Display fallback SVG with brand colors
```
