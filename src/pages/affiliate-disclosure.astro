          <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-off-white">Our Commitment to You</h2>
          <p>
            SwankyBoyz participates in various affiliate marketing programs, including the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. This means we may earn a commission when you click through our links and make a purchase â€” at absolutely no extra cost to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We only recommend products we've personally tested, genuinely believe in, and would confidently recommend to friends. Your trust is paramount, and we never compromise our editorial integrity for commissions.

          <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-off-white">How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
          <p>
            When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, the merchant pays us a small commission. This happens automatically through their tracking system and doesn't affect your purchase price in any way.
          </p>
          <p>
            These commissions help fund our independent product testing, expert research, and in-depth editorial content, allowing us to continue providing high-quality reviews and guides at no cost to you.

          <h2 class="font-display text-2xl text-off-white">Editorial Independence</h2>
          <p>
            Our editorial team operates independently from our affiliate partnerships. Product recommendations are based solely on:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Hands-on testing and real-world experience</li>
            <li>Expert analysis of ingredients, materials, and construction</li>
            <li>User feedback and community reviews</li>
            <li>Value for money and long-term performance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Commission rates never influence our recommendations. We frequently recommend lower-commission products if they offer superior value or performance.
