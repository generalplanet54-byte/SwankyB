# Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+: The Gold Standard of Daily Hydration

For over five decades, Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion has been a cornerstone of effective skincare routines worldwide. The enhanced "+" formula represents the evolution of this iconic moisturizer, incorporating advanced hydration technology while maintaining the gentle, dermatologist-approved approach that made the original a cult favorite.

## The Legacy of Dramatically Different

Clinique revolutionized skincare in 1968 with their 3-Step System, and the Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion was the crucial third step. This wasn't just another moisturizer â€“ it was the first dermatologist-developed daily moisturizer designed to work for all skin types, setting a new standard for inclusive skincare.
